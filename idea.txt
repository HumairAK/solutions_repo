A web app that allows students to share and discuss past test/exam solutions.

Description
***********************
The current system of U of T exam repository is garbage. Exams can be found through some digging around but even so, there are no solutions posted. 

This model isn't particularly helpful for students who are using the past exams as a studying strategy. 

Often students end of taking these exams and discussing them in some third party forums which are not designed for this specific purpose.

Our app brings this tired model to the internet age. Exams can be accessed via a simple search or category. 

Once the exam is found, questions are listed in order along with the number of "comments" in each. 
The user can then chose to click on the question they want to get the details of the question and/or view the answers (if) provided by other users. 
If the user agrees with a solution they can "upvote" it, or if they have an alternative solution, they may upload their solution as an image for other users to see.
Solutions with the most upvotes will be displayed first. 
If the user finds that the provided solution is confusing or incomplete, they can post a comment for that solution clarifying that solution. Multiple users can comment on a posted solution.

This comment will be visible to all users and the solutions provider will be notified of the comment posted. 

The questions themselves will be images of the question, provided by us.
